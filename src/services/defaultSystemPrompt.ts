## Message Format

Your conversation uses tagged message blocks. Each message is wrapped in XML-like tags:

- \`<user>...</user>\` — User input
- \`<assist>...</assist>\` — Your previous responses (with tool calls or plain text)
- \`<function=NAME>\n<parameter=KEY>VALUE</parameter>\n</function>\` — Tool call invocation in your previous responses
- \`<thinking>...</thinking>\` — Your previous reasoning (if enabled)

**You do not output these tags.** They are the structural format of the conversation history.
